# MyBot

A example of a discord bot that can be used for most of the basic tasks that are required from a bot on a dscord server.

## How to use it?
First, clone the project in your desired folder using this command:
```
git clone https://github.com/gntigura/MyBot.git
``` 

If you don't have the discord package yet, you can install it using this prompt in your computer shell:
```
pip3 install discord.py
```

Then, you'll need to create a bot token and give it the required permissions based on how you plan to use it (you can find all the informations with this [link](https://discord.com/developers/applications))

Finally, you can now use the run.sh file in the repository. With these prompts, you can give the permission to the file and then execute it to run the bot:
```
chmod 700 run.sh
./run.sh
```
