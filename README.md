# MyBot
A example of a discord bot that can be used for most of the basic tasks that are required from a bot on a dscord server.

## How to use it?
First, clone the project in your desired file using this command:
```
git clone https://github.com/gntigura/MyBot.git
``` 

If you don't have the discord package yet, you can install it using this prompt in your computer shell:
```
pip3 install discord.py
```

Then, you'll need to create a bot token and give it the required permissions based on how you plan to use it (you can find all the informations in this [link](https://discord.com/developers/applications))

After all this steps, you can now run the bot on your computer using this prompt in your shell:
```
python3 main.py
```
